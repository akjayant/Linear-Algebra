## Linear Algebra coding assignments as a part of E0-226 course at CSA,IISc,Bangalore
 #### We had to code everything from scratch i.e, no numpy!

 ### Assignment - 1
     1) Gauss Jordan for echleon forms
     2) Linear System of Equations

 ### Assignment 2
     1) Eigen Values and Eigen Vectors using QR Algorithm
     2) Centrality measures - Degree, Closeness and Eigenvector
     3) Spectral Clustering
     4) SVD  (Numpy allowed just for calculating eigen space and matrix multiplication)
     5) t-SNE (just for visualization)
